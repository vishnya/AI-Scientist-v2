## Title

Context-Aware Language Models for Zero-Shot Temporal Reasoning

## Short Hypothesis

Integrating temporal logic representations and dynamic context embeddings into language models will enable zero-shot temporal reasoning, improving their ability to understand and reason about events over time without task-specific fine-tuning.

## Related Work

Recent advancements in language models have shown impressive results across various NLP tasks, but temporal reasoning remains a challenging area. Existing work, such as T5 and TimeBERT, often requires task-specific fine-tuning and struggles with zero-shot scenarios. Our approach distinguishes itself by focusing on zero-shot temporal reasoning through the integration of temporal logic and dynamic context embeddings, offering a novel direction for enhancing temporal understanding in language models.

## Abstract

Current language models like GPT-3 and BERT excel in many natural language processing tasks but struggle with temporal reasoning, especially in zero-shot settings. This project proposes a novel approach to enhance language models with context-aware temporal reasoning capabilities. By integrating temporal logic representations and dynamic context embeddings into the architecture, we aim to develop a model that can understand and reason about events over time without task-specific training. Leveraging large-scale text corpora and temporal datasets, the model will learn to encode temporal information explicitly, allowing it to perform zero-shot temporal reasoning tasks such as timeline reconstruction, event prediction, and causality inference. We hypothesize that this approach will significantly improve the model's ability to handle temporal queries and reason about time-dependent information, outperforming existing models that lack explicit temporal understanding. The expected outcome is a robust language model that can generalize temporal reasoning across various domains, contributing to advancements in areas like historical analysis, future event prediction, and automated timeline generation.
